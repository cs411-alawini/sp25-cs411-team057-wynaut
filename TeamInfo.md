## Project Summary

This website will be a budget tracker and expense management website that helps users efficiently manage their finances. With a built-in receipt scanner, users can simply upload an image of their receipt and the website will automatically extract information such as date, item, and price from the receipt and catalog the expense. Users will also be able to manually input any other expenses and choose categories these expenses fall under. There will also be an interactive dashboard to help visualize monthly/weekly expenses as well as provide a breakdown on how much was spent on each category.

The website will also have a bill splitting functionality which allows users to easily split any bills among multiple people. With an account system implemented, bills that are split will be able to be tracked on each personâ€™s expenses catalog, removing the need for more manual work.
